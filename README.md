# Follow along of react router tutorial

I made the follow along code provided in the page of [tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) react-router-dom.

This totorial was focused in V6 specifically. 

This is final result I'd would be great be made by tags for every section but I didn't realize that until I've finished.
